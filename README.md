IrrOculusVR
===========

Oculus Rift support for Irrlicht.

The implementation is made FPS cameras in mind. This means that the player's body cannot rotate
along other axes than Y. For cockpit-style cameras some modifications will be required.

The player's direction and head rotation aren't linked together.

main.cpp contains simple example of use.
