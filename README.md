IrrOculusVR
===========

Oculus Rift SDK 0.4.0 support for Irrlicht 1.8.1 using DirectX 9 and OpenGL. 

Supports both Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2.

The renderer can either take player's position and rotation around Y-axis as a parameter during
rendering or alternatively it's possible to link to player's head node. The linking is a good
solution for example for simulators while the other approach works nicely for FPS games.

main.cpp contains simple example using the FPS-approach.
